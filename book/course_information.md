# Learning objectives, activities and assessment ðŸ’¡

## Learning objectives
At the end of the statics part of this module, you show to be able to:
1.	Translate the main steps of the matrix method into a set of programming classes with distinct tasks
2. Extend the classes to solve arbitrarily complex frame problems in statics
3. Postprocess the analyses and recover continuum fields exactly

The matrix method for statics is part of the unit 2 of the course CIEM5000 Base: Structural Engineering.

## Learning activities
In this submodule, you'll have two lectures where we cover the content. This book represents the content of those lectures in [](lecture1.md) and [](lecture2.md) 

Next to that, you'll work on applying the content in two workshops. The assignments as part of these workshops are not-graded. This book represents the content of those workshops in [](workshop1.md) and [](workshop2.md).

Additional assignment are available to work on, which you should be able to make after finishing the workshops. These are available in [](additional.md).

On ... there'll be question hours for the full CIEM5000 module. During these you'll have the opportunity to ask questions on this submodule too.

## Assessment
The learning will be assessed with one assignment provided to you after the second workshops. This assignment is part of the Assignment Portfolio of unit 2, where it counts for 33%. This portfolio will account for 20% of your total grade of CIEM5000.

The deadline of the assignment is ..., although you're encouraged to finish it directly after completing workshop 2. Doing so allows you to split the workload evenly.

There's no supervisdd
During the exam assignments, you're allowed to bring your books, notes, etc. and you're allowed to use your laptop including software like SymPy. You're not allowed to communicate during the exam session, which will be strictly monitored. Furthermore, you're not allowed to use structural analysis software.

For each exam sessions(consisting of one or more assignments) you'll have three hours.

You pass the courses when you scores sufficient (minimum 6.0) for an assignments on each of the subjects. Each subject is graded separately as a partial grade.
