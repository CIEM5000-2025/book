During today's lesson we'll work on:
- Recap differential equations for structures
- Recap displacement method
- Element defined by nodal displacements as degrees of freedom
- Combine elements with nodal equilibrium
- Local and global stiffness matrix
- Apply Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions
- Local-global transformations
