    "After solving for discrete nodal displacements, we can use the expressions derived in [](../lecture1/single_element.md) and [](./element_loads.md) to obtain continuous results. Remember than the nodal displacements are in the global coordinate system, which needs to be converted back into the local coordinate systems ($ \\bar {\\mathbf{u}}^e = \\mathbf{T}\\mathbf{u}^e$) to use the derived expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to create a figure which combines the internal forces / displacements of multiple elements, you need the results in the global coordinate system again. In the provided code, this is implemented with a boolean operation `global_c` in the class `elements.py` function `plot_moment_diagram` and `plot_displaced`. For example, the frame treated in [](../workshop1/Workshop_1_Apply.ipynb) gives the following displaced shape:"
