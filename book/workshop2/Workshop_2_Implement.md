# Workshop 2 - Implementation
    
In this notebook you will continue to implement the matrix method and check it with some sanity checks.

+++

You're given an updated version of the matrixmethod package, although still incomplete.

> ### Task 0
>
> Check whether your implementation of last week was correct using the provided solution

```{code-cell} ipython3
import numpy as np
import matrixmethod as mm
%config InlineBackend.figure_formats = ['svg']

%load_ext autoreload
%autoreload 2
```

## 1. The Node class
The `Node` class from last week is unchanged and complete

+++

## 2. The Element class

The implementation is incomplete:
- The function `add_distributed_load` should compute the equivalent load vector for a constant load $q$ and moves those loads to the nodes belonging to the element. Remember to use the `add_load` function of the `Node` class to store the equivalent loads (remember we have two nodes per element). Also keep local/global transformations in mind and store `self.q = q` for later use;
- The function `bending_moments` receives the nodal displacements of the element in the global coordinate system (`u_global`) and uses it to compute the value of the bending moment at `num_points` equally-spaced points along the element length. Keep local/global transformations in mind and use the ODE approach in SymPy / Maple / pen and paper to compute an expression for $M$. Do the same for for $w$ in the function `full_displacement`.

> ### Task 2.1
>
> Add the missing pieces to the code, before you perform the checks below.

+++

> ### Task 2.2
>
> Having made your implementations, it is now time to verify the first addition of your code with a simple sanity check. We would like to solve the following simply-supported beam:
> <center>
>  <figure>
>    <IMG SRC="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibcmrocha/public/main/ssbeam.png" WIDTH=200>
>  </figure>
></center>
>
> Choose appropriate values yourself.
>
> Use the code blocks below to set up this problem. After you've added the load, print the element using `print(YOUR ELEMENT)`. Do the shown values for the nodal loads correspond with what you'd expect?

```{code-cell} ipython3
#YOUR CODE HERE
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(#YOUR ELEMENT HERE
```

> ### Task 2.3
>  Now solve the nodal displacements. Once you are done, compare the rotation at the right end of the beam. Does it match the solution you already know?

```{code-cell} ipython3
#YOUR CODE HERE
```

> ### Task 2.4
> Calculate the bending moment at midspan and plot the moment distribution using `plot_moment_diagram`. Do the values and shape match with what you'd expect?

```{code-cell} ipython3
u_elem = con.full_disp(#YOUR CODE HERE)
#YOUR CODE HERE
```

> ### Task 2.5
> Calculate the deflection at midspan and plot the deflected structure using `plot_displaced`. Do the values and shape match with what you'd expect?

```{code-cell} ipython3
#YOUR CODE HERE
```

## 3. The Constrainer class

We're going to expand our Constrainer class, but the implementation is incomplete:
- The constrainer class should be able to handle non-zero boundary conditions too. `constrain` should be adapted to do so + the docstring of the class itself. Furthermore, the assert statement of `fix_dof` should be removed.
- The function `support_reactions` is incomplete. Since the constrainer is always first going to get `constrain` called, here we already have access to `self.free_dofs`. Together with `self.cons_dofs`, you should have all you need to compute reactions. Note that `f` is also passed as argument. Make sure you take into account the contribution of equivalent element loads that go directly into the supports without deforming the structure.

> ### Task 3.1
>
> Add the missing pieces to the code and docstring, before you perform the checks below.

+++

> ### Task 3.2
>
> We're going to verify our implementation. Therefore, we're going to solve an extension bar, supported at both ends, with a load $q$.

> Choose appropriate values yourself.
>
> Can you say on beforehand what will be the displacements? And what will be the support reactions?
> Use the code blocks below to set up and solve this problem and check the required quantities to make sure your implementation is correct.

```{code-cell} ipython3
#YOUR CODE HERE
```

> ### Task 3.3
>
> Again, we're going to verify our implementation. Therefore, we're going solve a beam, with a load $F$ and support displacement $\bar w$ for the right support.
