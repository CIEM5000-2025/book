# Graded assignment

When you've finished the workshops, you can start with the graded assignment. The process is very similar to the workshops, but now there's a deadline and you're required to write a report. You're going to solve a to be provided structural model for displacements and internal forces using the Matrix Method.

Whenever the model is provided, please open the assignment from GitHub Classroom (to be provided too) to work on it locally. The solution won't be provided.

First, analyse the model and the questions you're required to answer:
1. Explain which part of this assignment you cannot solve with the code developed in the workshop.
2. Explain in words and math how you added new implementation and describe alternatives you considered for deriving, modelling and coding these.
3. Explain why your sanity checks prove that all of your code implementations are correct.
4. Make a table of all nodal displacement and show the displaced structure in a figure. Indicate how you identify nodes.
5. Show the moment diagram of the structure in a figure.
6. Provide a figure (this specific figure can be hand drawn) of a free body diagram of the full structure in which you show all the forces working on the structure (including support reactions) with numerical values from your code.
7. Provide a figure (this specific figure can be hand drawn) of a free body diagram of the the indicated node with numerical values from your code.
8. Comment on any potential mistakes you observed in your final answers.
9. If you had the time to expand this Matrix Method with an additional feature, what would that be?

Then, add new implementations to your code in `./matrixmethod/`, and provide sanity checks to your implementations `Graded_Implement.ipynb`. Then, solve and postprocess the problem in `Graded_Apply.ipynb`. Add a report in `.pdf` or `.md` format in which you included answers and reasoning for all the questions. Make sure all the values/figures you use in the report are solved/created with your code. Furthermore, you're expected to provide well-formatted figures and Markdown text, as well as logically organise any auxiliary files you may use.

Commit your repository to the provided GitHub Classroom repository (to be provided) before the deadline to hand in your assignment. Your latest commit before the deadline in the `main` branch will be graded. Incomplete assignments will be graded with a 1. The full solution won't be provided.

Feedback will be provided via Brightspace.
